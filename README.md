#### Description
***This is my final project for Harvard's CS50x course. I'm glad to be able to finish this course and make this project.***

<b>HOW I LANDED ON THIS PROJECT</b>
<br> I started learning <b>MACHINE LEARNING</b> after finishing all the videos and assignments of cs50x. And while learning what all has to be covered, I came across a python library called <b>OPENCV</b> used for image processing and computer vision using several kinds of algorithms. I had seen people driving cars in GTA V by moving their fingers, that really caught my attention. I saw a basketball net which could move made using opencv and laws of physics, just wow! 
Well, I learnt its basics and tried implementing this.
At first, I had a creative thought of making a YEARBOOK<sub>cs50x</sub>, and it would have used Python, Flask, Sql, and then HTML, CSS, JS, so pretty much everything, but I could not bring myself to make it. I was not too convinced plus frontend is not something I love. But i still think that this is a good idea and one day or the other, you will find a github repo for the same in the mail or on discord! :)

<b>FACE RECOGNITION CHECK IN SYSTEM USING PYTHON</b>
1. This project captures your name and photo, verifies your identity, and stores the name and time in a CSV file.<br>
2. It uses the following Python libraries: <BR>
                                    1. OPENCV <BR>
                                    2. NUMPY <BR>
                                    3. FACE_DETECTION <BR>
                                    4. TKINTER <BR>

<B>OPENCV</B><br>
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It was initially developed by Intel and later supported by Willow Garage and Itseez. OpenCV provides a comprehensive suite of tools and algorithms for real-time computer vision applications, making it popular among developers and researchers.<br> 

The library is written in C++ and has interfaces for multiple languages, including Python, Java, and MATLAB, allowing for wide accessibility and ease of integration into various projects. OpenCV includes numerous functions for image processing, video capture and analysis, facial recognition, object detection, and feature extraction. Its capabilities extend to tasks such as edge detection, color space conversions, template matching, and camera calibration.<br> 

OpenCV is designed for computational efficiency and is suitable for applications in both embedded systems and high-performance computing environments. It is widely used in fields like robotics, augmented reality, automated inspection, and medical imaging. The extensive documentation and active community support further enhance its usability, making OpenCV a go-to library for computer vision enthusiasts and professionals.<br> 

<b>FACE_RECOGNITION</b><br>
The face_recognition library in Python is a highly regarded tool for facial recognition and manipulation, built on top of dlib's cutting-edge face recognition technology. It provides simple, efficient methods to detect, recognize, and manipulate faces using deep learning techniques. This library offers robust capabilities for identifying and verifying faces in images and videos, making it suitable for various applications, including security systems, user authentication, and photo organization.<BR>

Key features of the face_recognition library include facial landmark detection, face comparison, face clustering, and the ability to recognize faces from a pre-trained model. The API is user-friendly, allowing developers to quickly implement face detection and recognition functionalities with minimal code. The library's accuracy and performance are well-regarded, making it a popular choice for both hobbyists and professionals in the field of computer vision.<BR>

Additionally, face_recognition supports a wide range of platforms and can be integrated with other libraries and frameworks, enhancing its versatility and application scope. Whether for building smart security systems, organizing large photo collections, or enabling innovative user experiences, the face_recognition library provides the necessary tools to work with facial data effectively and efficiently.<BR>


<B>NUMPY</B><br>
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a foundational package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. NumPy is renowned for its performance, allowing efficient computation and manipulation of large datasets, making it a cornerstone of data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research.<BR>

Key features of NumPy include:<BR>

1. N-dimensional array object: The ndarray is a fast, flexible container for large datasets in Python, supporting multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. <BR>
2. Broadcasting: This feature allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes, simplifying code and improving performance.<BR>
3. Mathematical functions: A comprehensive suite of mathematical operations, including linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and statistical functions.<BR>
4. Integration with other libraries: Seamlessly integrates with other scientific libraries like SciPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, enhancing its capabilities for data analysis and visualization.<BR>
5. Efficiency: Written in C, NumPy operations are significantly faster and more memory-efficient than native Python loops. <BR>
<BR>

<B>CSV</B><br>
CSV, or Comma-Separated Values, is a widely-used format for storing and exchanging tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a row in the table, with values separated by commas. CSV files are plain text, making them easy to create and read using various software applications, including spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, as well as programming languages such as Python, R, and Java.<BR>

One of the main advantages of CSV files is their simplicity and compatibility. They can be easily generated by any text editor and are supported by almost all data analysis tools. This makes CSV an ideal format for data exchange between different systems and applications. Additionally, CSV files are human-readable, which means they can be manually edited and understood without the need for specialized software. <BR>

However, CSV files also have some limitations. They lack support for more complex data types and structures, such as hierarchical data or nested arrays. They also do not inherently support metadata, such as data types or encoding information, which can lead to potential issues when importing or exporting data between systems. Despite these limitations, CSV remains a popular and practical choice for many data storage and transfer needs due to its simplicity and broad compatibility. <BR>

<b>TKINTER</b><br>
Tkinter's capabilities are extensive, allowing for the development of more complex applications as well. It supports various widgets and geometry management methods, enabling precise control over the layout and behavior of the interface. Additionally, Tkinter applications can be extended with custom widgets and advanced functionalities through Pythonâ€™s robust ecosystem.<BR>

Despite being simple, Tkinter is highly versatile. It includes features for handling events, managing application states, and integrating with other libraries for tasks such as plotting graphs or connecting to databases. This versatility, combined with its integration into the Python Standard Library, makes Tkinter a go-to choice for Python developers needing a reliable and easy-to-use GUI toolkit.

<BR>
After integrating and using the functions of these libraries judiciously, I made this project.<br> Hope you liked it!
